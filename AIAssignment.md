1) `/AIChats` for images

2) I used AI when my CLI wasn’t printing anything, even though the script was running with no errors. I wasn’t sure which part was wrong: how I parsed arguments, how I read the JSON file, or if Node just wasn’t executing the file. The AI pointed out that I was missing the shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env node`) at the top of `cli.ts`, which tells the system to treat the file as an executable CLI script. After adding it and rebuilding, the CLI printed results normally. The response was correct, and I used it directly without changes. I verified what the shebang does by looking it up, so I actually understood why that fixed the problem.

3) I also used AI to help format my README quickly. I already knew what needed to be in it, but I didn’t want to spend a long time writing it out. The AI generated a simple version with install instructions, CLI usage, and how to import the validator in code. I skimmed it, edited some wording, and pasted it into my README. No hallucinations there—it was just basic formatting, and it saved time.

4) When my tests first failed, Jest complained about "cannot use import statement outside a module." I recognized it had something to do with TypeScript not being compiled during tests, but I wasn’t sure what config I was missing. The AI told me to create a Jest config using ts-jest and gave me the exact file contents. After adding it, npm test worked and all my tests passed. I looked up ts-jest afterwards and learned that it transforms TypeScript files into JavaScript so Jest can execute them. I used the solution directly because it was correct.
